# NOTE:
# IBKR limits historical data per request â†’ get_bars() must fetch in chunks
# and stitch results without gaps. Watch for rate limits: large backtests
# may be impractical. If so, swap in another provider (e.g. Alpaca).
# We keep OHLCV raw/decoupled so indicators are only added later.

# I will give you info to my person account for you to keep in your .env files. 
# IBKR Gateway will need to be running on your machine as well to establish a connection.
